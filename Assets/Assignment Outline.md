# ASC Assignment Outline

### By Campbell McTernan u7484835


For your convenience I have compiled a few notes about the project as we have not discussed the intent and details of this Assignment in person. The assignment guidelines I wrote were:

"*The Assignment will be one submission, consisting of a substantial planning and design document on the artifact of code to be submitted. This should include specification / functionality plans, systems hierarchy charts, descriptions of datastructures / methods and descriptions on the plans for the algorithms used.*"

The design specification document is intended to show specification / functionality plans and descriptions of data structures. I have also created a very substantial code artifact with most functions intended for use, and lengthy docstrings providing their purpose. Finally, I have simple hierarchy charts in this registry too. As the coding scaffold is so rigorous, and I intend for this and the Design specification to be the bulk of the submission I have left the hierarchy chart quite plain. I believe that by looking at the code submission the structure is quite self-apparent. Overall I did not intend this project submission to be so large but the scope of the package got away from me. Apologies for creating such a large artifact to mark. I think you can mainly look to the code scaffold to provide feedback.
