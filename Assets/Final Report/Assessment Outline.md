# ASC Final Report Outline
### By Campbell McTernan u7484835

  
For your convenience I have compiled a few notes about the project as we have not discussed the intent and details of this Assignment in person. 

### Project Summary

This research course will focus on the detailed exploration and analysis of the online board game Risk: Global Domination or similar variants. Risk is a multi-player, turn based, diplomacy driven game with an objective to capture all territories on the board. With up to 6 players, optimal gameplay must include careful communication and cooperation between players. The goal of this project is to design and implement an AI bot to play Risk with more profficiency than the current foremost AI standard, or otherwise perform an equivalent turing test to act passably as a human player. Students will examine both machine learning and symbolic AI methods to achieve this goal. Students will finish this course by producing a program which implements a significantly developed AI, examining its performance and presenting the findings in a short lecture.

  
### Project Outcomes
Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
1. Identify algorithms, data structures and an operational interface best suited to Risk as a Non-deterministic diplomacy based game.
2. Implement this framework into a working bot with the capacity to respond dynamically and diplomatically to other players
3. Design and perform an empirical evaluation of the approach/es used, discuss improvements which could be made, and state the conclusions that the evaluation supports.Oral Presentation will discuss the implementation, progress and challenges of the project, with a particular focus on the work done to address the Risk game's specific gameplay. Student will present and teach the research group on this area.

### Assessment Details

" The final Report will consist of a 35% (total weighting) code artifact which implements advanced algorithms to play the Risk game in an interesting and significant way, perhaps focusing on communication and cooperation or statistically optimal play. The other 35% will consist of a technical report discussing the algorithms and approach/es used, with empirical evaluations of performance and future improvements."

### Submission Notes

The design specification document is intended to show specification / functionality plans and descriptions of data structures. I have also created a very substantial code artifact with most functions intended for use, and lengthy docstrings providing their purpose. Finally, I have simple hierarchy charts in this registry too. As the coding scaffold is so rigorous, and I intend for this and the Design specification to be the bulk of the submission I have left the hierarchy chart quite plain. I believe that by looking at the code submission the structure is quite self-apparent. Overall I did not intend this project submission to be so large but the scope of the package got away from me. Apologies for creating such a large artifact to mark. I think you can mainly look to the code scaffold to provide feedback.
